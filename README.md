# Tilted Towers

Welcome to the Tilted Towers code challenge. Given the design below, create a responsive React app that displays Fortnite stats for everybody's favorite streamer, Ninja. Never heard of Fortnite. Don't like Ninja..

In this challenge, the ScoutSDK library will be used to pull data from a public Fortnite stats API. Documentation can be found [here](https://www.scoutsdk.com/developers/docs/getting-started/web). The app and keys have already been created and the library has already been included in the HTML. The rest is up to you. Just build, baby! See what I did there?

## Design
![stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1694414/51521378-50135b80-1ddb-11e9-933d-90ba254887e3.png)

## Challenge Rules
* Recreate the design above using Ninja's current season stats. The design is just a guideline. Your app doesn't need to keep things pixel perfect. Or even use all the stats shown in the design. We just want to see your process. Get creative, but keep the three box layout. One box for each game mode (solo, duo, squad).
* Mobile first design. Make the boxes stack on smaller displays.
* Use React. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* Any and all other libraries or JS packages/modules are fair game.
* Don't push to master.
* No more rules.

__Step 1:__ Create a branch off of master with your name in it. `npm install` and start building. You can find an example API call in `/src/scout.js`.

__Finished?__ Create a pull request and submit.

__Extra Credit:__ Use React Router to lookup other players. For example: `localhost:3000/Not%20Tfue`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
